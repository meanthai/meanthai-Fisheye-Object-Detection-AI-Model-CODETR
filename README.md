Challenge Track 4: Road Object Detection in Fish-Eye Cameras

Fisheye lenses have gained popularity owing to their natural, wide, and omnidirectional coverage, which traditional cameras with narrow fields of view (FoV) cannot achieve. In traffic monitoring systems, fisheye cameras are advantageous as they effectively reduce the number of cameras required to cover broader views of streets and intersections. Despite these benefits, fisheye cameras present distorted views that necessitate a non-trivial design for image undistortion and unwarping or a dedicated design for handling distortions during processing. It is worth noting that, to the best of our knowledge, there is no open dataset available for fisheye road object detection for traffic surveillance applications. The datasets (FishEye8K and FishEye1Keval) comprises different traffic patterns and conditions, including urban highways, road intersections, various illumination, and viewing angles of the five road object classes in various scales.
